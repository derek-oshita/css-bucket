                You may be surprised to hear that it took me a while to gather
                my thoughts before I was able to write them down. I felt as if
                there were a million ways I could begin this love letter as I
                look back on the 10 years that you and I have spent together. As
                I sit here and write this message, above all else, I wanted to
                let you know that I love you deeply and that I am so damn proud
                of you.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's been a fascinating experience watching you grow these past
                10 years. I have seen you tossed into the throes of struggle
                many times and emerge from the other side with your head held
                higher than ever. You dance through life with such grace and yet
                your resolve is both unwavering and unapologetic. You put in
                earnest effort into the relationships you value and make time
                for all of the important moments that life has to offer. You
                live a beautiful life, Chelsea, please remember that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Neither of us really knows what the future holds, but let's use
                this time together to create life experiences we'll never
                forget. Happy 30th birthday, Chelsea!
              </p>
