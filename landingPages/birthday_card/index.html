            You may be surprised to hear that it took me a while to gather my
            thoughts before I was able to write them down. I felt as if there
            were a million ways I could begin this love letter as I look back on
            the 10 years that you and I have spent together. As I sit here and
            write this message, above all else, I wanted to let you know that I
            love you deeply and that I am so damn proud of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's been a fascinating experience watching you grow these past 10
            years. I have seen you tossed into the throes of struggle many times
            and emerge from the other side with your head held higher than ever.
            You dance through life with such grace and yet your resolve is both
            unwavering and unapologetic. You put in earnest effort into the
            relationships you value and make time for all of the important
            moments that life has to offer. You live a beautiful life, Chelsea,
            please remember that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither of us really knows what the future holds, but let's use this
            time together to create life experiences we'll never forget. Happy
            30th birthday, Chelsea!
